Incredible! Aren't you just the most eager cutie pie!
Now, let me tell you a story.
Zorian is a teenage mage of humble birth and slightly above-average skill, attending his third year of education at Cyoria's magical academy.
He is a driven and irritable young man, consumed by a desire to ensure his own future and free himself of the influence of his family, whom he resents for favoring his brothers over him.
Consequently, he has no time for pointless distractions or paying attention to other people's problems. As it happens, time is something he is about to get plenty of.
On the eve of the Cyoria's annual summer festival, he is killed and brought back to the beginning of the month, just before he was about to take a train to Cyoria.
Now, what have you learned?
Yes!
Now go and collect 50 gold pieces! I'll wait for you at the temple.
